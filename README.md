# Rapid Notes Plugin

## To do in version 1.2.6
- Refactor code
- Add/remove commands without the need to reload Obsidian/plugin
- Add tests
- Note refactoring capability
- Choose opening preference from dropdown (avoid creating too many commands)
- Choose to focus on new note or not
- Pick template for note
- Add pinned folders to suggester
- Impreove demo
- "Fuzzy search" prefixes (dynamic helpbox)

Place notes in specific folders at the moment of creation using the prefixes defined in settings. Optionally add custom prefixes to the filenames and trigger the creation in specific folders with shortcuts or from the editor while typing links.

## New in version 1.2

### Create notes into your folders right from the editor
- You can trigger the rapid note functionality from the editor, calling the command with the cursor placed within a text in double brackets, or selecting text, with alias support incorporated.
### New features with settings available
- You can add an actual prefix to the name of the created note.
- Customize the escape symbol used to avoid moving the note based on the prefix ("/" by default).
- Add a common separator between the prefix and the filename.
- If the new file about to be created already exists, you can choose to open the existent file or create a new one with the same name followed by a number.
- Updated modal with the list of prefixes as memory help. Can be disabled through the settings.
- Option to capitalize the folder and file names.
- Add commands (which can be binded to hotkeys) that allow you to trigger any prefix entry and create the file directly into a folder (same as the Rapid Note command, it can be opened in same tab, new tab, background tab, new pane or new window).

### New commands
- Instead of a single "Rapid Note" command, now you can open the file in the same tab, new tab, background tab, new pane or new window.

### New hidden features
- If a used folder is renamed/deleted, a warning is shown. In case it's renamed, the entry is updated.
- In the folder suggester, show first the preferred saving location according to the Obsidian settings: Vault folder, an specified location, or the same folder as the current active file.
- If the filename contains "/" the full path is created: folders and filename following the last slash character.

### More
- Plugin styles improved for the mobile experience.
- Lots of bug fixes and code improvements. Removed lookbehind in regular expressions which could lead to issues in some iOS versions. Tested in iOS 16.4.1.
- Newly introduced bugs to be fixed.

# Quick demo video

A couple of notes the video may not be too clear about: when creating a new note from the editor from a selection, the link to it is created. The escaping character ("/" by default) works both inline and on the prompt.

## How to use

In the plugin settings add prefix/folder pairs, considering prefixes must be single words and are case sensitive. Each prefix and folder can be used a single time. When you run the `Rapid Notes: New note` command (which can be binded to a new hotkey or replace the default "Create New Note" hotkey) if you input the prefix previously set, it's going used to create a new note using the input value without the prefix as name. If no prefix matches, a folder suggest is open. If your input begins with a slash `/` then the prefix will be ignored and you will always be prompted with a folder suggester.

## Example of basic usage

If you have a folder named `JavaScript` in your vault where you save all notes regarding JavaScript, you could add in the Rapid Notes settings the prefix `js` and assign it to said folder. Upon triggering the command to create a new note, you could enter into the prompt `js Promises` and a new file named `Promises` will be saved into the `JavaScript` folder.


## Example of escaped prefix

If you have your `js` prefix set, but you wish to create a new file named `js rulez`, then you can simply input `/js rulez` into the prompt and you will be prompted to select where to create the new file.


## Considerations

- You can combine Rapid Notes with [Templater plugin](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater) to speed up your workflow even further, assigning templates for folders and enabling the setting to trigger Templater on file creation.

## Installation

Find "Rapid Notes" in the Community plugins through the Obsidian app!

## Development

1. Clone this repo and place it in a new vault for development inside `.obsidian/plugins/` folder.
2. Install NodeJS, then run `npm i` in the command line under the repo folder.
3. Run `npm run dev` to compile your plugin from `main.ts` to `main.js`.
4. Make changes to `main.ts` (or create new `.ts` files). Those changes should be automatically compiled into `main.js`.
5. Reload Obsidian to load the new version of your plugin ("Reload app without saving" in the command palette for refreshing).
6. Enable plugin in settings window.
